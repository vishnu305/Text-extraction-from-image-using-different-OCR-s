# Text-extraction-from-image-using-different-OCR-s

In this project, we used an open source named easyOCR and paddleOCR which can recognize the text in the given image, my main motive of this idea is to extract the medicines from doctor's prescription so that we can suggest the patients where can they find those and we can alert them to take that medicine.
so for that idea the main role is to extract the doctor's cursive writing also, so i tried to build a model which can extract text from given image.
